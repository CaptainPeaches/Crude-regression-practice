# Crude-regression-practice
Linear, quadratic regression on prostitute data 1800's. Also includes Mortality Ratio for black plague 1600's. 

# Prostitution Data
My code for creating a plot of the # of prostitutes during the time. Then creates a linear, and quadratic line overlaying the first plot. 

# Mortality Ratio
The code for plotting the mortality ratio over the time of the mid 1600's to mid 1700's. Also creates a fitted spline-like plot to the data.
